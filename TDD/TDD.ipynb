    "3. Functional Test: Verify the feature. Ex: login features.\n",
    "4. End-to-end Testing: Verify the entire application from start to fininsh, this test involves frontend, backend and any other external servieces. \n",
    "5. Load Testing: Verify how the application performs under heavy traffics.\n",
    "   - Tools: JMeter, K6\n",
    "6. Acceptence Testing: Verify whether the application meets the business requirements and is ready for production.\n",
    "7. Performance Testing: Verify the application's responsiveness, stability, and scalibity.\n",

    "### Why do we need mocking in TDD?\n",
    "In TDD, mocking is a technique used to create fake implementation of external dependencies or objects that is required to run a unit of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Different types of mocking:***\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Manual Mocking: In this approach we manually create the interfaces that is required for running a unit of code.\n",
    "2. Mocking Framework: `Moq` is a popular framework in .Net Core that simplifies the creation of mock objects.\n",
    "3. Stub Mocking: It returns a predefined data when certain methods are called.\n",
    "4. Fake Objects: Fakes are similar to stub mocks but can have actual implementation.\n",
    "5. Spy Objects: A spy is a type of objects that records information about how it was interacted with.\n",
    "   - verify certain methods are called\n",
    "   - verify with expected arguments.\n",
    "6. Auto mocking: Create mocks for all dependencies of the class being tested. "

    "### XUnit Terminology\n",
    "   - `Arrange:` Set up the test by initializing objects, preparing data and setting up the environment.\n",
    "   - `Act:` Execute the method or function under the tests.\n",
    "   - `Assert:` Verify the outcome to ensure that the behavior is expected\n",
    "  \n",
    "Attribute for Test Method:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `[Fact]`: Marked as a test method nad does not take any arguments.\n",
    "2. `[Theroy]`: Marked as a data driven test. It allows to pass multiple sets of data to the same test methods.\n",
    "   - `[InlineData(3,5,8)]`: Suppiels parameters directly to the `Theory` method.\n",
    "   - `[MemberData(nameof(GetTestData))]`: Supplies parameters from a member of a class `-ex: property, method`.\n",
    "   - `[ClassData(typeof(MathTestData))]`: Supplies parameter from a class that implements `IEnumerable<object[]>`.\n",
    "   - `[Trait]`: allows to add categories to test, that is helpful to filter tests by category when running them.\n",
    "   - `[Skip]`: It can be used both `[Fact]` and `[Theory]` with a reason to skip the test.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Common Assertions:***\n",
    "1. `Assert.Equal(expected, actual)`: Verfies that two values are equal.\n",
    "2. `Assert.NotEqual(unexpected, actual)`: Verfies that two values are not equal.\n",
    "3. `Assert.True(condition)`:Verfies that a condition is true.\n",
    "4. `Assert.False(condition)`:Verfies that a condition is false.\n",
    "5. `Assert.Throws<ExceptionType>(delegate)`: verfies that a specific exception happen.\n",
    "6. `Assert.Null(object)`: varifies that a object is Null.\n",
    "7. `Assert.NotNull(object)`: varifies that a object is not Null.\n",
    "8. `Assert.Collection(list, item=> Assert.Equal(1, item), item=> Assert.Equal(2, item))`: varifies that a collection contains a given number of elements, and each element satisfies an assertion.\n",
    "9. `Assert.InRange(value, 1,10)`: Varifies that  a value is within a specified range.\n",
    "10. `Assert.Contains(2, list)`: Ensure thar a collection contains a specific element.\n",
    "11. `Assert.DoesNotContain`: Ensure thar a collection does not contain a specific elements.\n",
