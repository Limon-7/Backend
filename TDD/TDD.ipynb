    "1. Unit Test: Verify individual components or units of code-like function.\n",
    "2. Integrating Testing: Verify the integration points between different components or service. Ex: `web api and database`.\n",
    "3. Functional Test: Verify the feature. Ex: login features.\n",
    "4. End-to-end Testing: Verify the entire application from start to fininsh, this test involves frontend, backend and any other external servieces. \n",
    "5. Load Testing: Verify how the application performs under heavy traffics.\n",
    "   - Tools: JMeter, K6\n",
    "6. Acceptence Testing: Verify whether the application meets the business requirements and is ready for production.\n",
    "7. Performance Testing: Verify the application's responsiveness, stability, and scalibity.\n",
    "8. Security Testing: Identify vulnarabilities and ensure the application security against attacks.\n",

    "### Why do we need mocking in TDD?\n",
    "In TDD, mocking is a technique used to create fake implementation of external dependencies or objects that is required to run a unit of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Different types of mocking:***\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Manual Mocking: In this approach we manually create the interfaces that is required for running a unit of code.\n",
    "2. Mocking Framework: `Moq` is a popular framework in .Net Core that simplifies the creation of mock objects.\n",
    "3. Stub Mocking: It returns a predefined data when certain methods are called.\n",
    "4. Fake Objects: Fakes are similar to stub mocks but can have actual implementation.\n",
    "5. Spy Objects: A spy is a type of objects that records information about how it was interacted with.\n",
    "   - verify certain methods are called\n",
    "   - verify with expected arguments.\n",
    "6. Auto mocking: Create mocks for all dependencies of the class being tested. "
